The Urgency of Combating Human Trafficking for Online Scams in Indonesia,Budi Hermawan Bangun,The Urgency of Combating Human Trafficking for Online Scams in Indonesia,2025.0,,"trafficking for online scams has emerged as a growing transnational crime, particularly in Southeast Asia. This study examines the role of ASEAN in combating this evolving form of human trafficking, highlighting its legal framework, challenges, and regional cooperation efforts. ASEAN has established multiple agreements, including the ASEAN Convention Against Trafficking in Persons (ACTIP) and the ASEAN Leaders' Declaration on Combating Trafficking in Persons Caused by the Abuse of Technology, to address the issue. However, the implementation of these agreements remains inconsistent due to the region’s adherence to the “ASEAN Way” principle, which prioritizes non-interference and consensus-based decision-making. This research employs a socio-legal approach, analyzing ASEAN’s institutional response and the legal framework supporting anti-trafficking measures. Findings indicate that while ASEAN has made significant strides in formalizing commitments, enforcement gaps persist. Human traffickers exploit weak border controls, technological advancements, and corruption to sustain their operations. Additionally, the rise of cyber fraud linked to trafficking in persons has intensified the urgency for coordinated regional action. The study underscores the need for ASEAN member states to adopt stronger enforcement mechanisms, improve victim protection, and enhance cross-border cooperation. Strengthening ASEAN’s role in combating human trafficking for online scams is crucial not only for upholding human rights but also for maintaining regional security and economic stability.

Oil palm plantations in Indonesia are owned not just by large corporations, but also by smallholders known as MSMEs (Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises). One of the Indonesian government's strategies to strengthen the capacity of MSMEs is to encourage large enterprises and MSMEs to form core-plasma partnerships. Large enterprises frequently incur various violations when implementing the palm oil industry partnership. As a result, adequate supervision from a government authority is essential. The purpose of this study is to examine the legal basis for the supervision of the Indonesian Competition Commission (‘ICC’; Komisi Pengawas Persaingan Usaha) on the implementation of core-plasma partnerships, to boost the oil palm plantation industry in Indonesia.

The research typology used is analytical-descriptive, with the goal of fully and comprehensively explaining the duties and authorities of the ICC in supervising partnership implementation in Indonesia, and then evaluating them to determine the legal basis for the ICC's participation in partnership implementation. The analysis found that Law No. 9 of 1999 on the Prohibition of Monopolistic Practices and Unfair Business Competition does not regulate the ICC's authority to supervise partnerships. However, under Law No. 20 of 2008 on MSMEs and the implementation regulations, the ICC has the authority to oversee the implementation of core-plasma cooperation, namely through consultations, evaluations, suggestions, and considerations related to government policies, policy harmonization and law enforcement.",establishing equality in the coreplasma partnership in palm oil business the role of the indonesia competition commission oil is the main product that has contributed significantly to the indonesian and malaysian economy over the past few decades oil palm plantations in indonesia are owned not just by large corporations but also by smallholders known as msmes micro small and medium enterprises one of the indonesian governments strategies to strengthen the capacity of msmes is to encourage large enterprises and msmes to form coreplasma partnerships large enterprises frequently incur various violations when implementing the palm oil industry partnership as a result adequate supervision from a government authority is essential the purpose of this study is to examine the legal basis for the supervision of the indonesian competition commission icc komisi pengawas persaingan usaha on the implementation of coreplasma partnerships to boost the oil palm plantation industry in indonesia this study type is normativejuridical and relies on secondary data sources to make assessments the research typology used is analyticaldescriptive with the goal of fully and comprehensively explaining the duties and authorities of the icc in supervising partnership implementation in indonesia and then evaluating them to determine the legal basis for the iccs participation in partnership implementation the analysis found that law no  of  on the prohibition of monopolistic practices and unfair business competition does not regulate the iccs authority to supervise partnerships however under law no  of  on msmes and the implementation regulations the icc has the authority to oversee the implementation of coreplasma cooperation namely through consultations evaluations suggestions and considerations related to government policies policy harmonization and law enforcement,SDG 6,Sekunder

Liquidity barriers for the poor can be overcome by pension programs financed by the government and intergenerational transfers. This research aims at investigating determinants of the family size decisions in poor households. This research uses primary data from survey questionnaires conducted among 447 poor households selected in Family Planning Villages throughout Sintang Regency. The family size decision is only affected by parents’ expectation of an intergenerational transfer. This variable has a significant positive effect, and the possibility of an old-age pension scheme provided by the government does not significantly affect the family size decision. This may be due to the fact that there has been no pension scheme for poor households in Indonesia. The cost of children does not influence the poor household’s family size decision. This is probably due to family package assistance provided by the government which can help reduce the cost of children. The cost of daily living, health and education costs have a significant positive effect on the burden of these costs. The findings of this study indicate that the family assistance package provided by the government does not encourage poor households to have a larger family, meaning that the provision of family assistance packages does not contradict the Family Planning Program.

Independent prognostic factors were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazard model with a hazard ratio (HR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI).a total of 956 NSCLC cases were retrieved during the study; 268 (28.0%) were female patients. Mean of age in female patients was 56.9 (11.87) years old. Among female patients, 21 (7.8%) were smokers, 244 (91.1%) had adenocarcinoma subtype, and 261 (98.0%) were in advanced stage (III-IV). Median survival was slightly longer in female than male patients (14.9 months vs. 12.2 months; log-rank p=0.055). Significant prognostic factors for survival were older age (>50 y.o) (HR = 0.681; 95% CI = 0.467 - 0.992; p= 0.045) and positive eGFR mutation (HR = 0.393; 95% CI = 0.251 - 0.615; p<0.001).female patients contributed to about 28% of all NSCLC cases. They were mostly non-smokers, have more adenocarcinoma histopathology and eGFR mutation. Survival tended to be longer in female than male patients. Age over 50 years and the presence of eGFR mutation were good prognostic factors to survival in female lung cancer patients.",nonsmall cell lung carcinoma in women a retrospective cohort study in indonesia increasing incidence of lung cancer in female patients has been observed in indonesia lung cancer in female might have different biology process than male but it has never been evaluated in indonesia this study aimed to know characteristics and survival of female patients with nonsmallcell lung carcinoma nsclc in dharmais national cancer centre hospitala retrospective cohort study was performed among nsclc female patients in dharmais cancer hospital dch between january  and december  survival analysis was done using the kaplanmeir estimation curve with proportional assumption test independent prognostic factors were analyzed using the cox proportional hazard model with a hazard ratio hr and its  confidence interval cia total of  nsclc cases were retrieved during the study   were female patients mean of age in female patients was   years old among female patients   were smokers   had adenocarcinoma subtype and   were in advanced stage iiiiv median survival was slightly longer in female than male patients  months vs  months logrank p significant prognostic factors for survival were older age  yo hr    ci     p  and positive egfr mutation hr    ci     pfemale patients contributed to about  of all nsclc cases they were mostly nonsmokers have more adenocarcinoma histopathology and egfr mutation survival tended to be longer in female than male patients age over  years and the presence of egfr mutation were good prognostic factors to survival in female lung cancer patients,"SDG 15, SDG 9",Tersier
Corporate control agency problem and board composition: Evidence from Indonesia,Eddy Suratman,"Corporate control, agency problem and board composition: Evidence from Indonesia",2015.0,,"study investigates the impact of agency problem and the distribution of corporate control on board composition using a dataset consisting of 190 listed firms in Indonesia. The conceptual framework is derived from agency theory assuming that board composition is endogenously determined by firm’s specific environment. The study reveals that corporate control drives the composition of the board. The different types of large shareholders are found to pursue different strategies in relation to the board composition. While domestic and foreign investors rely on independent board, controlling family prefer to structure a less independent board. This suggests that the battle for corporate control between controlling family, in one side, and unrelated domestic and foreign investors begins with the structure of board. The findings imply that the type of large shareholder does matter in determining the device of corporate control.",corporate control agency problem and board composition evidence from indonesia study investigates the impact of agency problem and the distribution of corporate control on board composition using a dataset consisting of  listed firms in indonesia the conceptual framework is derived from agency theory assuming that board composition is endogenously determined by firms specific environment the study reveals that corporate control drives the composition of the board the different types of large shareholders are found to pursue different strategies in relation to the board composition while domestic and foreign investors rely on independent board controlling family prefer to structure a less independent board this suggests that the battle for corporate control between controlling family in one side and unrelated domestic and foreign investors begins with the structure of board the findings imply that the type of large shareholder does matter in determining the device of corporate control,SDG 8,Tersier

Data analysis in this research uses the Partial Least Square (PLS) technique which is an alternative method based on the variance of the variables used. The stages of data analysis are validity testing, reliability testing and hypothesis testing. The independent variables in this research are e-commerce and financial literacy, while the dependent variable is MSME sustainability performance. The results of this research show that e-commerce has a positive and significant relationship with MSME sustainability performance and financial literacy has a positive and significant relationship to MSME sustainability performance. In addition, e-commerce has a significant influence on the sustainability performance of MSMEs because the presence of e-commerce is one of the marketing alternatives used to reach more vendors and customers which can change the supply chain leads to social problem solution such as food distribution. Further, e-commerce may minimize traveling long distances for shopping resulting to the carbon footprint reduction. MSMEs have the same opportunity to use e-commerce as an alternative to maximize performance. However, not all MSMEs have the capability to use and utilize e-commerce optimally. After all, knowing good financial management will make it easier to make sustainable decisions since the higher the level of financial literacy, the MSME players can optimize their sustainability performance.",linking the role of ecommerce and financial literacy on msmes sustainability performance during the digital era recent years ecommerce has experienced a very significant increase ecommerce provides a broad overview of technology processes and practices that can be carried out without using paper as a means of transactions ecommerce can be a solution to the paper waste problem which is an environmental issue that can lead to social problems thus ecommerce has a vital role in achieving business sustainability performance ecommerce has had a big influence on the social and economic growth of todays society business managements ability to manage financial information is an important indicator in influencing micro small and medium enterprises msmes business performance good managements financial literacy equips msmes with knowledge and skill empowering msmes to make informed financial decisions manage resources effectively and promote sustainable development this research aims to analyze the relationship between ecommerce and the sustainability performance of msmes and analyze the relationship between financial literacy and its positive and significant relationship with the sustainability performance of msmes the research method uses a descriptive method with a quantitative approach the population in this research are msmes managers in indonesia who have comprehensive knowledge regarding the operations and performance of msmes in this study researchers used a simple random sampling technique with a sample size of  msme managers data analysis in this research uses the partial least square pls technique which is an alternative method based on the variance of the variables used the stages of data analysis are validity testing reliability testing and hypothesis testing the independent variables in this research are ecommerce and financial literacy while the dependent variable is msme sustainability performance the results of this research show that ecommerce has a positive and significant relationship with msme sustainability performance and financial literacy has a positive and significant relationship to msme sustainability performance in addition ecommerce has a significant influence on the sustainability performance of msmes because the presence of ecommerce is one of the marketing alternatives used to reach more vendors and customers which can change the supply chain leads to social problem solution such as food distribution further ecommerce may minimize traveling long distances for shopping resulting to the carbon footprint reduction msmes have the same opportunity to use ecommerce as an alternative to maximize performance however not all msmes have the capability to use and utilize ecommerce optimally after all knowing good financial management will make it easier to make sustainable decisions since the higher the level of financial literacy the msme players can optimize their sustainability performance,"SDG 8, SDG 9",Tersier

Unlocking the Potential of Unlabeled Data in Building Deep Learning Model for Dynamometer Cards Classification by Using Self-Supervised Learning,Rosyadi,Unlocking the Potential of Unlabeled Data in Building Deep Learning Model for Dynamometer Cards Classification by Using Self-Supervised Learning,2023.0,,"Dynamometer card is one of the vital surveillances for Sucker Rod Pump (SRP) performance monitoring in Duri field. Even though the field produces a massive number of cards, they come with no label or interpretation about the pump conditions based on the card shape. Self-supervised learning (SSL) consists of a pretext task that trains feature extractors by using unlabeled data as opposed to supervised learning, that requires a lot of effort in labeling data which is time consuming and costly. This paper evaluates the performance of a feature extractor, Alexnet, that is trained by using several pretext task techniques. This study used around 660,000 unlabeled cards while a small amount of labeled data was used for evaluation purposes using linear evaluation protocol. The result showed that the trained Alexnet using Pretext-Invariant Representation Learning (PIRL) with jigsaw has better performance by 6% compared to the pre-trained ImageNet model. Further fine-tuning process by using labeled data could achieve 93% accuracy. The model was also tested using fresh data and the result was compared to the expert's interpretation. This approach can potentially add more types of rod pump problems to detect in the Duri field with considerable precision.

Board capital effect on firm performance: Evidence from Indonesia,Wendy,Board Capital Effect on Firm Performance: Evidence from Indonesia,2021.0,,"capital effects have been ignored as important resources to induce the organization’s performance in firm-level research. The proponents of human capital theory and resource-based view theory argue that the human resources attached to each board member, such as networking, education, and experience, might induce the performance. Yet, agency theory argues those strategic resources might bring higher transaction costs and entrenchment costs. Therefore, this study aims to examine the board's capital effect on firm performance for a sample of 252 listed firms in Indonesia over 2011–2017.

Board capital and earnings quality with different controlling shareholders,Wendy,Board capital and earnings quality with different controlling shareholders,2020.0,,"The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between board capital and firm earnings quality with different controlling shareholders for a sample of 252 listed firms in Indonesia over the period 2011–2017. Design/methodology/approach This study uses a two-step dynamic generalized method of moments panel regression to estimate the board capital effect on earnings quality. The board capital measure is constructed from educational capital, networking capital and experience capital. Meanwhile, discretionary accrual is used as the proxy for earnings quality. All financial data is from the annual report. Board capital data is a combination of an annual report, RelSci data, Linkedin searching and Bloomberg data. Findings The findings of this study report that board capital has a significant effect on earnings quality. Higher board capital may result in better earnings quality. In further investigation, this study finds that firms with higher education backgrounds tend to have better earnings quality. Meanwhile, firms with higher experienced board members tend to have bad earnings quality. Additionally, networking capital does not have any impact on earnings quality. The findings of this study also document a strong size effect of controlling shareholders in moderating the relationship between board capital and earnings quality. Research limitations/implications This study contributes to upper-echelon, institutional, positive accounting and agency theory. It implies that agency cost plays an important role in that relationship. In a more deep analysis, this study records different board capital effects on earnings quality across controlling shareholders. Practical implications Shareholders should elect board directors following their competencies and should note that not all competencies will give a quality earning report. The educational background of board members will enhance earnings quality, but the experience of a board member will reduce the earnings quality. Further, the relationship between board capital and earnings quality is significantly moderated by controlling shareholders, implying that different controlling shareholders need different board capital. Originality/value This study examines board capital effects on earnings quality with different controlling shareholders using four major theories. The board capital measure is tedious and detailed allowing to capture the comprehensive human capital.",board capital and earnings quality with different controlling shareholders the purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between board capital and firm earnings quality with different controlling shareholders for a sample of  listed firms in indonesia over the period  designmethodologyapproach this study uses a twostep dynamic generalized method of moments panel regression to estimate the board capital effect on earnings quality the board capital measure is constructed from educational capital networking capital and experience capital meanwhile discretionary accrual is used as the proxy for earnings quality all financial data is from the annual report board capital data is a combination of an annual report relsci data linkedin searching and bloomberg data findings the findings of this study report that board capital has a significant effect on earnings quality higher board capital may result in better earnings quality in further investigation this study finds that firms with higher education backgrounds tend to have better earnings quality meanwhile firms with higher experienced board members tend to have bad earnings quality additionally networking capital does not have any impact on earnings quality the findings of this study also document a strong size effect of controlling shareholders in moderating the relationship between board capital and earnings quality research limitationsimplications this study contributes to upperechelon institutional positive accounting and agency theory it implies that agency cost plays an important role in that relationship in a more deep analysis this study records different board capital effects on earnings quality across controlling shareholders practical implications shareholders should elect board directors following their competencies and should note that not all competencies will give a quality earning report the educational background of board members will enhance earnings quality but the experience of a board member will reduce the earnings quality further the relationship between board capital and earnings quality is significantly moderated by controlling shareholders implying that different controlling shareholders need different board capital originalityvalue this study examines board capital effects on earnings quality with different controlling shareholders using four major theories the board capital measure is tedious and detailed allowing to capture the comprehensive human capital,SDG 12,Primer
The speed of adjustment towards optimal capital structure in Indonesia: A test of dynamic trade-off model,Wendy,The speed of adjustment towards optimal capital structure in Indonesia: a test of dynamic trade-off model,2019.0,,"structure remains to be a highly debated topic and the number of researches on the dynamic version of capital structure in Indonesia is very small. Besides, the inclusion of macroeconomic factors is even harder to locate. This paper analyzes the financing behaviour of non-financial firms in Indonesia. The objective is to measure the adjustment speed of the firms toward the optimal capital structure. Partial Adjustment Model (PAM) was used to analyzed the data. It is expected that non-financial firms in Indonesia possess a target leverage and make partial adjustments toward the target over time. The empirical findings from 250-panel data observation revealed that tangibility and firm’s size had a positive and significant relationship with target leverage. In addition, macroeconomic variables (GDP growth and inflation rate) were found to be negatively correlated with the firm’s speed of adjustment. Finally, the result shows that non-financial firms in Indonesia readjusted toward their target leverage at a speed rate of approximately 57.44% a year. These evidences conclude that the financing behaviour of non-financial firms in Indonesia tended to follow the dynamic trade-off theory.",the speed of adjustment towards optimal capital structure in indonesia a test of dynamic tradeoff model structure remains to be a highly debated topic and the number of researches on the dynamic version of capital structure in indonesia is very small besides the inclusion of macroeconomic factors is even harder to locate this paper analyzes the financing behaviour of nonfinancial firms in indonesia the objective is to measure the adjustment speed of the firms toward the optimal capital structure partial adjustment model pam was used to analyzed the data it is expected that nonfinancial firms in indonesia possess a target leverage and make partial adjustments toward the target over time the empirical findings from panel data observation revealed that tangibility and firms size had a positive and significant relationship with target leverage in addition macroeconomic variables gdp growth and inflation rate were found to be negatively correlated with the firms speed of adjustment finally the result shows that nonfinancial firms in indonesia readjusted toward their target leverage at a speed rate of approximately  a year these evidences conclude that the financing behaviour of nonfinancial firms in indonesia tended to follow the dynamic tradeoff theory,SDG 9,Tersier

Developing a model of employment creation in border region: Gaharu cultivation and honey bee farming in Bengkayang, West Kalimantan, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 21: 5237-5247. The border regions possess political, cultural, and socio-economic complexity. One of major problems in the border regions is the lack of employment opportunity following ups and downs in the economy, suggesting a need for a more sustainable employment opportunity by harnessing local conditions and practices. The main objective of the research was to construct an economic development model in the border region by integrating available natural resources, local initiatives, and external support to provide employment opportunities. We conducted the research in Jagoi Village, Bengkayang District, West Kalimantan, Indonesia which has border with Sarawak, Malaysia. We collected primary data through in-depth interviews, structured interviews, observation, and focus group discussion combined with secondary data. This information was then used to construct the model. Our research found that the population of Jagoi Village consisted of farmers (50%), menial laborers (30%), traders (17%), civil servants (2%), and ojek taxi drivers (1%). In the past, they also received additional income from collecting wild bee honey and gaharu (agarwood) resin. However, large tracks of forest area were cut by commercial loggers or converted into oil palm plantations. Fortunately, Jagoi Village has adat forest which preserved the forest from the expansion of oil palm plantation and is a source of non-wood products to use by the community could use. The research revealed that collecting wild bee honey and gaharu was no longer viable. Started from these conditions, we proposed a model of employment creation by cultivating gaharu and farming honey bee. As such, there is paradigm change from ‘collecting’ or ‘gathering’ into ‘cultivation’ and farming. To be successful, the model integrates six elements, consisting of awareness building, local initiatives, success stories as an example, external support or empowerment, field school, and independent execution. Using this approach the target community will be able to create new employment opportunities which eventually increases their income and prosperity.",developing a model of employment creation in border region gaharu cultivation and honey bee farming in bengkayang west kalimantan indonesia bariyah n  developing a model of employment creation in border region gaharu cultivation and honey bee farming in bengkayang west kalimantan indonesia biodiversitas   the border regions possess political cultural and socioeconomic complexity one of major problems in the border regions is the lack of employment opportunity following ups and downs in the economy suggesting a need for a more sustainable employment opportunity by harnessing local conditions and practices the main objective of the research was to construct an economic development model in the border region by integrating available natural resources local initiatives and external support to provide employment opportunities we conducted the research in jagoi village bengkayang district west kalimantan indonesia which has border with sarawak malaysia we collected primary data through indepth interviews structured interviews observation and focus group discussion combined with secondary data this information was then used to construct the model our research found that the population of jagoi village consisted of farmers  menial laborers  traders  civil servants  and ojek taxi drivers  in the past they also received additional income from collecting wild bee honey and gaharu agarwood resin however large tracks of forest area were cut by commercial loggers or converted into oil palm plantations fortunately jagoi village has adat forest which preserved the forest from the expansion of oil palm plantation and is a source of nonwood products to use by the community could use the research revealed that collecting wild bee honey and gaharu was no longer viable started from these conditions we proposed a model of employment creation by cultivating gaharu and farming honey bee as such there is paradigm change from collecting or gathering into cultivation and farming to be successful the model integrates six elements consisting of awareness building local initiatives success stories as an example external support or empowerment field school and independent execution using this approach the target community will be able to create new employment opportunities which eventually increases their income and prosperity,SDG 15,Primer
West Kalimantan-Sarawak border trade: Gravity model,Nurul Bariyah,West Kalimantan-Sarawak border trade: Gravity model,2019.0,,"study provides a comprehensive analysis of the border economy by focusing on the border trade conducted through the regional port of entry at Entikong (West Kalimantan, Indonesia)-Tebedu (Sarawak, Malaysia), by employing time-series secondary monthly data from January 1998 to September 2006. The vector error correction model exercise for the model indicated that the export equation was the only one in the system in which the error correction term (ECT) is statistically significant. This suggests that export solely bears the brunt of short-run adjustments in bringing about the long-run equilibrium in West Kalimantan, where it acts as the initial receptor of any exogenous shocks that disturb the equilibrium system. The ECT coefficient of
-0.839 represents the speed of adjustment of export towards equilibrium. The findings from the Gravity Model confirmed that three out of five independent variables are significantly related to cross-border trade. Of these three variables, economic size has a positive effect while income per capita difference and the ASEAN Free Trade Area have negative long run effects on export. The research suggests that West Kalimantan should focus its efforts on pursuing higher economic growth to lower the income per capita difference with Sarawak. Economic cooperation with Sarawak regarding complementarities should be considered.

Traditional spraying operations in paddy fields are dangerous as operators must deal with prolonged and frequent exposure to toxic chemicals. In the field experiment, an agricultural drone sprayed fertilizer and pesticides in the 1.5 ha paddy field in Parit Keladi Village, Kubu Raya Regency, West Kalimantan, Indonesia. For fertilizer and pesticide spraying, the impact on the paddy was measured periodically, involving paddy height and tiller number, randomly in the same field. Implementation in the area shows that the ground area coverage by the spraying drone was 6-7.5 m when it had an altitude is 4 m, with four nozzles and a 1,6 l/m spraying flow rate. This study implemented drone technology in the conventional paddy field, one of the famous agricultural commodities in Indonesia and other Asian countries.

Diversity and carbon sequestration capacity of naturally growth vegetation in ex-nickel mining area in Kolaka, Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 23: 1433-1442. Efforts to restore forest integrity on ex-mining lands are essential to improve environmental quality and sequester carbon. One such effort is through revegetation of post-mined land including in ex-nickel mining in Southeast Sulawesi. This research analyzes the diversity of naturally regenerating plant species in the ex-nickel mining area in Kolaka, Southeast Sulawesi and determines several local tree species with the potential for carbon sequestration. Vegetation survey was conducted using a systematic nested sampling method at the post-mined site with three vegetation types: secondary forest, shrubs and bushes, and a reference/control site (i.e., natural forest in the nearby Lamedai Nature Reserve). Different types of vegetation were analyzed based on factors using Discriminant Analysis. Vegetation composition was analyzed using the Importance Value Index. Furthermore, biodiversity indicators were analyzed using Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index, Species Evenness Index, and Sorensen Similarity Index. Carbon absorption was measured using the leaf sample method and carbohydrate test. The results showed that the condition of the research site had been disturbed, and the succession process was still ongoing. The species diversity at all plant levels was classified as moderate category and the distribution of the community was unstable. At the tree level, the undisturbed areas had higher diversity. Eradication of Chromolaena odorata was needed to preserve the native vegetation and accelerate forest succession. Tree species recommended for restoring the ex-nickel mining area and carbon sequestration as core plants include Vitex glabrata R.Br., Alstonia macrophylla Wall. ex G.Don, Lithocarpus celebicus (Miq.)

Feasibility Assessment of Converting Forest Into Palm Oil Plantation and Its Implication for Forest Policy and Palm Oil Sustainability Challenges: A Case Study in Melawi Regency of West Kalimantan Province Indonesia,Akhmad Yani,"Feasibility Assessment of Converting Forest Into Palm Oil Plantation and Its Implication for Forest Policy and Palm Oil Sustainability Challenges: A Case Study in Melawi Regency of West Kalimantan Province, Indonesia",2020.0,,"massive development of oil palm plantations puts significant pressure on forest converting in Melawi Regency, West Kalimantan Province. This is supported by the target of opening 200,000 ha of new oil palm plantations in West Kalimantan Province until 2034. Meanwhile, deforestation is the most critical climate change issue in tropical countries including Indonesia. This research examines the feasibility of clearing forest areas to be converted to palm oil plantations. This research employs the insurance approach to assess the benefits of forest ecosystems. Based on the calculation of the cost-benefits of financial and environmental feasibility, it is found that the protection of forest ecosystems is more feasible than opening palm oil plantations. However, based on the socio-economic cost-benefit calculation results, it is found that opening palm oil plantations is more feasible to implement than ecosystem protection activities. Finally, from the calculation of the total benefits-cost financial, environmental, and socio-economic feasibility, it is found that forest ecosystem protection activities are more feasible to implement than opening palm oil plantations. Another finding stated that an opening of 10,000 ha forest area for palm oil plantations would cause 6.4401 times more damage than the benefits that might be obtained if 10,000 ha of forest area ecosystem is not converted into a palm oil plantation area.",feasibility assessment of converting forest into palm oil plantation and its implication for forest policy and palm oil sustainability challenges a case study in melawi regency of west kalimantan province indonesia massive development of oil palm plantations puts significant pressure on forest converting in melawi regency west kalimantan province this is supported by the target of opening  ha of new oil palm plantations in west kalimantan province until  meanwhile deforestation is the most critical climate change issue in tropical countries including indonesia this research examines the feasibility of clearing forest areas to be converted to palm oil plantations this research employs the insurance approach to assess the benefits of forest ecosystems based on the calculation of the costbenefits of financial and environmental feasibility it is found that the protection of forest ecosystems is more feasible than opening palm oil plantations however based on the socioeconomic costbenefit calculation results it is found that opening palm oil plantations is more feasible to implement than ecosystem protection activities finally from the calculation of the total benefitscost financial environmental and socioeconomic feasibility it is found that forest ecosystem protection activities are more feasible to implement than opening palm oil plantations another finding stated that an opening of  ha forest area for palm oil plantations would cause  times more damage than the benefits that might be obtained if  ha of forest area ecosystem is not converted into a palm oil plantation area,SDG 9,Tersier

IMPULSE BUYING AND HEDONIC BEHAVIOUR: A MEDIATION EFFECT OF POSITIVE EMOTIONS,Heriyadi M.E.,Impulse Buying and Hedonic Behaviour: A Mediation Effect of Positive Emotions,2022.0,,"paper is devoted to building a miniature of an impulse buying behaviour in department stores, which is influenced by hedonic shopping value, store environment, and price discount factors, which involve the role of positive emotions as a mediator. A comparative causal-based quantitative approach examines empirical relationships. Characteristics of the questionnaire invite respondents to be surveyed at Matahari and Transmart Department Stores in Pontianak who are instructed to use purposive sampling. In the next procedure, interpreting the data is processed with SmartPLS, which emphasizes the structural model. The results of the investigation demonstrated that hedonic shopping value had a significant effect on positive emotions at Matahari and Transmart. However, the store environment actually has a significant effect on positive emotions at Transmart, but has no effect at Matahari. It was also detected that positive emotions have a significant effect on impulse buying at Matahari. Interestingly, it has no impact in the case study at Transmart. Later, hedonic shopping value appeared to have a significant effect on impulse buying at Transmart, while at Matahari it did not. Further exploration also found that the store environment had a significant effect on impulse buying at Matahari, while at Transmart it had no effect. This work also confirms that the discount has no effect on impulse buying at Matahari and Transmart.

This research was conducted to propose a conceptual model regarding affective, cognitive, and environmental responses to viral marketing, which are moderated by audience behavior, for the movie trailer of “Spiderman: Far from Home.” The film was released in July 2019 by Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). This study adopted the wheel of consumer analysis to bridge the research gap. An online survey was forwarded to 200 respondents using structured questionnaires through social media sites, such as Line, WhatsApp, Facebook, and e-mail. The data were then analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results showed that the audience’s affective, cognitive, and environmental responses significantly influenced viral marketing. The results further indicated that the audience’s behavior was not a moderating variable, as the significance level was less than 0.05.

This research aims at investigating determinants of the family size decisions in poor households. This research uses primary data from survey questionnaires conducted among 447 poor households selected in Family Planning Villages throughout Sintang Regency. The family size decision is only affected by parents’ expectation of an intergenerational transfer. This variable has a significant positive effect, and the possibility of an old-age pension scheme provided by the government does not significantly affect the family size decision. This may be due to the fact that there has been no pension scheme for poor households in Indonesia. The cost of children does not influence the poor household’s family size decision. This is probably due to family package assistance provided by the government which can help reduce the cost of children. The cost of daily living, health and education costs have a significant positive effect on the burden of these costs. The findings of this study indicate that the family assistance package provided by the government does not encourage poor households to have a larger family, meaning that the provision of family assistance packages does not contradict the Family Planning Program.

Effect of the farmer term of trade and farmworkers wages on rural unemployment and poverty in Indonesia,Restiatun,Effect of the farmer term of trade and farmworkers wages on rural unemployment and poverty in Indonesia,2024.0,,"study aims to determine the determinants of the welfare of agricultural sector workers who come from poor households in rural areas. The exchange rate of farmers and the wages of farm laborers will affect the level of employment in the agricultural sector, which in turn will affect the level of rural poverty. The methodology used in this study uses a panel data regression model with a recursive equation model. The best model for unemployment estimation is the random effect model, while the best model for poverty estimation is the fixed effect model. The results showed that the daily wage of farm laborers had a significant negative effect on unemployment. This may be due to the fact that higher wages will increase the number of workers who are willing to work in the agricultural sector, so unemployment will fall. While the unemployment variable has a significant positive effect on the level of rural poverty. The practical implication of these research findings is that to reduce poverty in rural areas, efforts from the government are needed to increase the wages of farm laborers, as the government sets minimum wages in the formal sector.

Aquatic processing enhances the loss of aged carbon from drained and burned peatlands,Gusti Zakaria Anshari,Aquatic processing enhances the loss of aged carbon from drained and burned peatlands,2024.0,,"Water‐logged peatlands store tremendous amounts of soil carbon (C) globally, accumulating C over millennia. As peatlands become disturbed by human activity, these long‐term C stores are getting destabilized and ultimately released as greenhouse gases that may exacerbate climate change. Oxidation of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) mobilized from disturbed soils to streams and canals may be one avenue for the transfer of previously stored, millennia‐aged C to the atmosphere. However, it remains unknown whether aged peat‐derived DOC undergoes oxidation to carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) following disturbance. Here, we use a new approach to measure the radiocarbon content of CO 2 produced from the oxidation of DOC in canals overlying peatland soils that have undergone widespread disturbance in Indonesia. This work shows for the first time that aged DOC mobilized from drained and burned peatland soils is susceptible to oxidation by both microbial respiration and photomineralization over aquatic travel times for DOC. The bulk radiocarbon age of CO 2 produced during canal oxidation ranged from modern to ~1300 years before present. These ages for CO 2 were most strongly influenced by canal water depth, which was proportional to the water table level where DOC is mobilized from disturbed soils to canals. Canal microbes preferentially respired older or younger organic C pools to CO 2 , and this may have been facilitated by the use of a small particulate organic C pool over the dissolved pool. Given that high densities of canals are generally associated with lower water tables and higher fire risk, our findings suggest that peatland areas with high canal density may be a hotspot for the loss of aged C on the landscape. Taken together, the results of this study show how and why aquatic processing of organic C on the landscape can enhance the transfer of long‐term peat C stores to the atmosphere following disturbance.",aquatic processing enhances the loss of aged carbon from drained and burned peatlands waterlogged peatlands store tremendous amounts of soil carbon c globally accumulating c over millennia as peatlands become disturbed by human activity these longterm c stores are getting destabilized and ultimately released as greenhouse gases that may exacerbate climate change oxidation of the dissolved organic carbon doc mobilized from disturbed soils to streams and canals may be one avenue for the transfer of previously stored millenniaaged c to the atmosphere however it remains unknown whether aged peatderived doc undergoes oxidation to carbon dioxide co   following disturbance here we use a new approach to measure the radiocarbon content of co  produced from the oxidation of doc in canals overlying peatland soils that have undergone widespread disturbance in indonesia this work shows for the first time that aged doc mobilized from drained and burned peatland soils is susceptible to oxidation by both microbial respiration and photomineralization over aquatic travel times for doc the bulk radiocarbon age of co  produced during canal oxidation ranged from modern to  years before present these ages for co  were most strongly influenced by canal water depth which was proportional to the water table level where doc is mobilized from disturbed soils to canals canal microbes preferentially respired older or younger organic c pools to co   and this may have been facilitated by the use of a small particulate organic c pool over the dissolved pool given that high densities of canals are generally associated with lower water tables and higher fire risk our findings suggest that peatland areas with high canal density may be a hotspot for the loss of aged c on the landscape taken together the results of this study show how and why aquatic processing of organic c on the landscape can enhance the transfer of longterm peat c stores to the atmosphere following disturbance,SDG 17,Sekunder
Quantifying the fluxes of carbon loss from an undrained tropical peatland ecosystem in Indonesia,Gusti Zakaria Anshari,Quantifying the fluxes of carbon loss from an undrained tropical peatland ecosystem in Indonesia,2024.0,,"Conservation of undrained tropical peatland ecosystems is critical for climate change mitigation as they store a tremendous amount of soil carbon that is preserved under anoxic water-logged conditions. Unfortunately, there are too few measurements of carbon fluxes from these ecosystems to estimate the climate change mitigation potential from such conservation efforts. Here, we measured carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ) fluxes as well as fluvial organic carbon export over the peat swamp forest within an undrained tropical peatland landscape in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Our measurements throughout one year (Oct 2022–Sep 2023) showed that despite its water-logged condition, peat and water overlying the swamp forest on average emits 11.02 ± 0.49 MgCO 2 ha −1 yr −1 of CO 2 and 0.58 ± 0.04 MgCO 2 e ha −1 yr −1 of CH 4 . Further, the fluvial organic carbon export contributes to additional carbon loss of 1.68 ± 0.06 MgCO 2 e ha −1 yr −1 .

Fire in the rainforest: A 3200-year history of fire in a West Kalimantan Indonesia tropical rainforest,Gusti Zakaria Anshari,"Fire in the rainforest: A 3200‐year history of fire in a West Kalimantan, Indonesia, tropical rainforest",2024.0,,"Despite its perceived historical rarity, fire is an important disturbance in tropical rainforests. Very large rainforest fires have been observed multiple times in recent decades, often during years of strong El Niño‐Southern Oscillation droughts. Fire in rainforest has major short‐term consequences for humans and wildlife by converting forest to fire‐prone fern, shrub, and grass, but the long‐term effects remain to be seen. Borneo's indigenous groups have been using fire to clear land for centuries, yet the prevalence and spatial patterns of premodern fire across forest types in Borneo are not well understood. This research set out to reconstruct fire in a 1500‐ha primary rainforest spanning 800 m of elevation in Indonesian Borneo with the goal of elucidating the role humans have played in rainforest fire. We found that humans played an important role in the occurrence of fire in recent centuries. Evidence of fire—charcoal &gt;2 mm—is more abundant in forest types where humans would be more likely to live and/or practice swidden agriculture. However, pyrogenic material is ubiquitous across the study area, showing that all forest types have experienced fire. A set of 50 radiocarbon dates showed that in lowland areas—where human‐caused fire is most likely—fire occurred throughout the last 3200 years, peaking 1300–1600 ce . The upland areas lacked evidence of fire before 1250 ce but otherwise had a similar pattern to the lowlands. The period of high fire coincides with regional demographic changes as well as regional droughts documented elsewhere in Southeast Asia. In upland areas, fires likely burned only under regional drought when fires could more easily spread upslope. Although forest plot studies at this site show little structural evidence of past fires, tree diversity is lower than expected in the most burned areas (alluvial benches). Thus, our results suggest that land clearance was a major source of fire, but the current intact state of these rainforests indicates that they were largely resilient to fires and land use hundreds of years ago. Recent fires mirror patterns of fire spread that occurred hundreds of years ago, though their severity and extent are likely much greater.",fire in the rainforest a year history of fire in a west kalimantan indonesia tropical rainforest despite its perceived historical rarity fire is an important disturbance in tropical rainforests very large rainforest fires have been observed multiple times in recent decades often during years of strong el niosouthern oscillation droughts fire in rainforest has major shortterm consequences for humans and wildlife by converting forest to fireprone fern shrub and grass but the longterm effects remain to be seen borneos indigenous groups have been using fire to clear land for centuries yet the prevalence and spatial patterns of premodern fire across forest types in borneo are not well understood this research set out to reconstruct fire in a ha primary rainforest spanning  m of elevation in indonesian borneo with the goal of elucidating the role humans have played in rainforest fire we found that humans played an important role in the occurrence of fire in recent centuries evidence of firecharcoal gt mmis more abundant in forest types where humans would be more likely to live andor practice swidden agriculture however pyrogenic material is ubiquitous across the study area showing that all forest types have experienced fire a set of  radiocarbon dates showed that in lowland areaswhere humancaused fire is most likelyfire occurred throughout the last  years peaking  ce  the upland areas lacked evidence of fire before  ce but otherwise had a similar pattern to the lowlands the period of high fire coincides with regional demographic changes as well as regional droughts documented elsewhere in southeast asia in upland areas fires likely burned only under regional drought when fires could more easily spread upslope although forest plot studies at this site show little structural evidence of past fires tree diversity is lower than expected in the most burned areas alluvial benches thus our results suggest that land clearance was a major source of fire but the current intact state of these rainforests indicates that they were largely resilient to fires and land use hundreds of years ago recent fires mirror patterns of fire spread that occurred hundreds of years ago though their severity and extent are likely much greater,SDG 9,Tersier
Factors influencing mangrove carbon storage and its response to environmental stress,Gusti Zakaria Anshari,Factors influencing mangrove carbon storage and its response to environmental stress,2024.0,,"forests serve as significant carbon sinks and play a crucial role in mitigating climate change. Currently, the response of mangroves to intensified climate change and human activities, and the factors that influence the magnitude of carbon storage in their sediments remain uncertain. To address these questions, two sediment cores were collected from the mangrove reserve in Pearl Bay, Guangxi, China. The activity of 210 Pb in the sediment, grain size, bulk elemental composition, stable carbon isotopes, lignin, and different sediment organic matter (OM) fractions were investigated to determine the local mangrove’s response to climate change and human activities, as well as the factors influencing its carbon storage. The results showed mangrove forests with lower tidal ranges, slower sedimentation rates, and where OM predominantly originated locally tend to have larger carbon stocks. The mangrove OM (MOM) decreased progressively from the bottom to the top of the cores, indicating that the mangroves in Pearl Bay have possibly undergone degradation, which was further substantiated by the decrease in lignin content. Based on these results, the entire cores were divided into two stages: stable stage 1 (1963–2001) and degradation stage 2 (2001–2020). The cause of the mangrove degradation is likely due to the impact of human activities; however, these impacts are anticipated to gradually lessen in the future due to mangrove protection policies.

Surachman,The effect of biostimulants and red mud on the growth and yield of shallots in post-unlicensed gold mining soil,2024.0,,"Shallot production in West Kalimantan is still low. Land that has the potential for the development of shallots is the soil from post-unlicensed gold mining (PUGM). The soil at PUGM was exploited very extensively and can be used to develop shallots, but it is obstacled by low pH values and nutrient content. This research aims to investigate the impact of biostimulants and red mud on the growth and yield of shallots. The experiment was carried out in two stages: (1) investigated the ratio of the red mud and PUGM soil at the laboratory and (2) investigated the biostimulants and red mud effect on two varieties of shallots in a screen house. For the second experiment, there were three factors. The first factor was the biostimulant (0, 2, 3, and 4%); the second factor was the dose of red mud (0, 2, and 4 tons ha −1 ); and the third factor was the shallot varieties (Bima Brebes and Tajuk). The results of the first research indicated that the application of the red mud and PUGM soil in a ratio of 1:500 and 1:1,000 had a pH of 7.88 (slightly alkaline) and 7.24 (neutral), respectively. The second study found that a 2% concentration of biostimulant increased plant height and tuber count by 23.78 cm and 6.55 tubers, respectively. The Bima Brebes variety produced better fresh tubers weight clump −1 and dry tubers weight clump −1 than the Tajuk variety, with, respectively, 42.08 g (7.36 tons ha −1 ) and 32.60 g (5.71 tons ha −1 ). These findings show that the use of the biostimulants and red mud together in integrated management can help shallots grow and produce more, especially on PUGM land that has obstacles with low soil fertility.

Water-table Depth and Peat Subsidence Due to Land-use Change of Peatlands,U. Edi Suryadi,Water-table Depth and Peat Subsidence Due to Land-use Change of Peatlands,2018.0,,"aims of the study were to reveal changes in the water-table depth and peat subsidence due to land-use change in West Kalimantan. The location of the study is peatland in Kubu Raya District-West Kalimantan, namely on four types of peatland-use, including secondary peat forest (SPF), shrubs (SB), oil palm plantation (CPP) and corn field (CF). The research parameters include depth of groundwater and peat subsidence. The results show that the conversion of peatland to other peatlands causes an increase in peat subsidy. The research parameters include water-table depth and peat subsidence. The results show that the land-use change of peatlands to other peatlands causes an increase in peat subsidence. The increase in subsidence in measurement II (October 2016) coincides with an increase in water-table depth and measurement V (April 2017) of 74.6%-90.9%. There is a tendency to increase water-table depth in August and October 2016 and January 2017, especially on SB, OPP and CF. SPF has a deeper water-table depth and deeper subsidence than other land. This is due to the deeper peat soil depth of the SPF (509 cm) while the other relatively shallow areas range from 108.2 to 115.5 cm.

However, there is limited efficiency in financial management and low resource allocation for rural finance operations to support the development of rural economies. This study tried to prove whether household financial management promotes rural development using the theories of transaction cost, financial transaction management, public expenditure management, and a rural development framework. This research was conducted in Sambas District, West Kalimantan, using a mixed method with purposive sampling and structured questionnaires administered to 200 independent oil palm smallholders. Multidimensional scaling and a structural equation model were employed to analyze the data. The results unveiled that household financial management promoted rural development due to its effects on accessibility and infrastructure for market opportunities, basic and public services, and governance regarding participation in agriculture meetings and training by the government. Governance emerged as the most direct effect of rural development as it contributed to livelihoods, community-based economic empowerment, human resources, and rural environmental problems. Operational and risk management came as the most influential factors in household financial management. Government played a role in engaging smallholders in supply chains, access to inputs, and households’ transition in confronting a variety of yields, unstable output and input prices, and changes in production technology.

The effect of biostimulants and red mud on the growth and yield of shallots in post-unlicensed gold mining soil,Tantri Palupi,The effect of biostimulants and red mud on the growth and yield of shallots in post-unlicensed gold mining soil,2024.0,,"Shallot production in West Kalimantan is still low. Land that has the potential for the development of shallots is the soil from post-unlicensed gold mining (PUGM). The soil at PUGM was exploited very extensively and can be used to develop shallots, but it is obstacled by low pH values and nutrient content. This research aims to investigate the impact of biostimulants and red mud on the growth and yield of shallots. The experiment was carried out in two stages: (1) investigated the ratio of the red mud and PUGM soil at the laboratory and (2) investigated the biostimulants and red mud effect on two varieties of shallots in a screen house. For the second experiment, there were three factors. The first factor was the biostimulant (0, 2, 3, and 4%); the second factor was the dose of red mud (0, 2, and 4 tons ha −1 ); and the third factor was the shallot varieties (Bima Brebes and Tajuk). The results of the first research indicated that the application of the red mud and PUGM soil in a ratio of 1:500 and 1:1,000 had a pH of 7.88 (slightly alkaline) and 7.24 (neutral), respectively. The second study found that a 2% concentration of biostimulant increased plant height and tuber count by 23.78 cm and 6.55 tubers, respectively.

Land-use changes and food insecurity around oil palm plantations: Evidence at the village level,Jajat Sudrajat,Land-Use Changes and Food Insecurity around Oil Palm Plantations: Evidence at the Village Level,2021.0,,"conversion of oil palm plantations in the villages of West Kalimantan has caused drastic changes in how farmers fulfill their basic household needs. One such change affects farmers’ food security. This study aimed to explain the deterioration of food self-sufficiency at the village level due to the pressure to use residual pockets of land for oil palm cultivation. The collected evidence was analyzed through an assessment of their residual pockets of land in a single village. A case study survey collected data from July until September 2019 in the village of Batu Barat, district of Kayong Utara, West Kalimantan Province, Indonesia. The study utilized 70 family heads as samples for interviews. They were selected through a simple random sampling technique. We used descriptive quantitative and qualitative methods in our investigation.

The use of subsidence to estimate carbon loss from deforested and drained tropical peatlands in Indonesia,Evi Gusmayanti,The Use of Subsidence to Estimate Carbon Loss from Deforested and Drained Tropical Peatlands in Indonesia,2021.0,,"is a major means of the conversion of tropical peat forests into agriculture. Accordingly, drained peat becomes a large source of carbon. However, the amount of carbon (C) loss from drained peats is not simply measured. The current C loss estimate is usually based on a single proxy of the groundwater table, spatially and temporarily dynamic. The relation between groundwater table and C emission is commonly not linear because of the complex natures of heterotrophic carbon emission. Peatland drainage or lowering groundwater table provides plenty of oxygen into the upper layer of peat above the water table, where microbial activity becomes active. Consequently, lowering the water table escalates subsidence that causes physical changes of organic matter (OM) and carbon emission due to microbial oxidation. This paper reviews peat bulk density (BD), total organic carbon (TOC) content, and subsidence rate of tropical peat forest and drained peat. Data of BD, TOC, and subsidence were derived from published and unpublished sources. We found that BD is generally higher in the top surface layer in drained peat than in the undrained peat. TOC values in both drained and undrained are lower in the top and higher in the bottom layer. To estimate carbon emission from the top layer (0–50 cm) in drained peats, we use BD value 0.12 to 0.15 g cm−3, TOC value of 50%, and a 60% conservatively oxidative correction factor. The average peat subsidence is 3.9 cm yr−1. The range of subsidence rate per year is between 2 and 6 cm, which results in estimated emission between 30 and 90 t CO2e ha−1 yr−1. This estimate is comparable to those of other studies and Tier 1 emission factor of the 2013 IPCC GHG Inventory on Wetlands. We argue that subsidence is a practical approach to estimate carbon emission from drained tropical peat is more applicable than the use of groundwater table.",the use of subsidence to estimate carbon loss from deforested and drained tropical peatlands in indonesia is a major means of the conversion of tropical peat forests into agriculture accordingly drained peat becomes a large source of carbon however the amount of carbon c loss from drained peats is not simply measured the current c loss estimate is usually based on a single proxy of the groundwater table spatially and temporarily dynamic the relation between groundwater table and c emission is commonly not linear because of the complex natures of heterotrophic carbon emission peatland drainage or lowering groundwater table provides plenty of oxygen into the upper layer of peat above the water table where microbial activity becomes active consequently lowering the water table escalates subsidence that causes physical changes of organic matter om and carbon emission due to microbial oxidation this paper reviews peat bulk density bd total organic carbon toc content and subsidence rate of tropical peat forest and drained peat data of bd toc and subsidence were derived from published and unpublished sources we found that bd is generally higher in the top surface layer in drained peat than in the undrained peat toc values in both drained and undrained are lower in the top and higher in the bottom layer to estimate carbon emission from the top layer  cm in drained peats we use bd value  to  g cm toc value of  and a  conservatively oxidative correction factor the average peat subsidence is  cm yr the range of subsidence rate per year is between  and  cm which results in estimated emission between  and  t coe ha yr this estimate is comparable to those of other studies and tier  emission factor of the  ipcc ghg inventory on wetlands we argue that subsidence is a practical approach to estimate carbon emission from drained tropical peat is more applicable than the use of groundwater table,SDG 9,Tersier
CO2 fluxes from drained tropical peatland used for oil palm plantation in relation to peat characteristics and crop age after planting,Evi Gusmayanti,CO2 fluxes from drained tropical peatland used for oil palm plantation in relation to peat characteristics and crop age after planting,2019.0,,"expansion of oil palm plantation on peatland has changed its important role for carbon sink into a carbon source. Conversion of peat swamp forest with high carbon density into a monoculture of oil palm has released the significant amount of carbon into atmosphere either carbon previously stored in forest biomass or carbon stored in peat organic matter. Drainage canal to artificially lower groundwater level as a prerequisite of oil palm cultivation provides the favorable condition for soil microbes activities in decomposing peat organic matter resulted in CO2 flux increase. The fluctuation of groundwater level and variation of environmental factors near the peat surface may regulate the rate of CO2 released from the soil. We aimed to measure CO2 fluxes from two sites of oil palm plantation with different peat characteristics and analyzed the correlation with groundwater level, soil temperature, air temperature, gravimetric water content, peat pH, oxidative reductive potential, and crop age. The measurement has been conducted from September 2016 to April 2017 in West Kalimantan, Indonesia by using portable infrared gas analyzer EGM 4. In addition to soil sampling at the same time as the gas measurement, we collected soil samples for some peat characteristics analysis consist of bulk density, particle density, porosity, soil organic matter, ash content, carbon, and nitrogen content prior to CO2 flux measurement. Our result shows that the difference of peat chemical characteristics between two sites has resulted in different CO2 flux. Oil palm ages seemed to affect CO2 flux by regulating microclimatic condition around crop canopy. Another finding is the insignificant relationship between CO2 fluxes and groundwater level unless the groundwater level reached more than 50 cm from the peat surface.

Local knowledge on landscape sustainable-hydrological management reduces soil CO2 emission, fire risk and biomass loss in West Kalimantan Peatland, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 20: 725-731. Local knowledge in managing peatlands, especially in the area of peat hydrology, has been practiced through generations to manage peatlands for agriculture and small scale gardens. Farmers in West Kalimantan have developed the way to conserve water by making simple dams using soil or woody plants to hold water from the peat upstream areas on small channels or rivers. To reduce puddles during rain or tides, people make small trenches, so-called parit cacing in the middle of the larger channel. The trench cross-section size is ~30-40 cm2. This channel can maintain the peat water level to the extent of the depth of the channel. These channels, at the same time, are useful, for a clear, easy land ownership border for one farmer family land. The results of CO2 emissions assessment at various water levels on the peatland landscape demonstrate that the landscape which surrounded by the parit cacing trenches can maintain lower CO2 emissions compared to the one that has deeper water levels. The knowledge to develop this channel has also reduced the risk of peatland fire hazard and the amount of peat biomass loss on a fire event. An assessment on the effect of water level on the loss of peat biomass when burned, reduce 30-78% loss risks if compared to water table depth of 60-80cm, which is assumed as general practices on peatland recently.

Enhancing water levels of degraded bare tropical peatland in West Kalimantan Indonesia: Impacts on CO2 emission from soil respiration,Evi Gusmayanti,"Enhancing water levels of degraded, bare, tropical peatland in West Kalimantan, Indonesia: Impacts on CO2 emission from soil respiration",2018.0,,"D, Burhanuddin, Gusmayanti E, Widiastuti T, Taherzadeh MJ. 2018. Enhancing water levels of degraded, bare, tropical peatland in West Kalimantan, Indonesia: Impacts on CO2 emission from soil respiration. Biodiversitas 19: 522-527. The major drivers of deforestation in West Kalimantan have been the development for large or small-scale expansion of agricultural activities; the establishment of oil palm and other plantations; fire; and degradation of forests particularly from industrial logging. Our previous research findings have shown that such activities in affected peatland areas have lowered the water table levels (down to 0.5-1.0 m depths), and have significantly increased CO2 emissions from the peat soils. It has been demonstrated that unmanaged, lowered water tables in peatlands act as one of the main factors inflating soil carbon emissions - an issue that has assumed global significance in recent decades. Regulating peatland water tables has the potential to mitigate degraded peatland carbon emissions as well as improve the hydrological functions for communities who farm the peatlands. However, we are still uncertain exactly how much impact controlled raising of the peatlands water tables will have on reducing soil CO2 emissions. The research described here aimed to mitigate CO2 emissions by raising and regulating water levels on drained peatland to restore and enhance its hydrological functions. The results confirmed that raising the water table significantly decreases CO2 emissions and improves water availability and management for crop production in the coastal peatland of Kubu Raya district, West Kalimantan. Water levels previously at 60cm below the soil surface were regulated to raise the watertable up to just 30 cm below the surface and this reduced peatland carbon emissions by about 49%.

A cost-efficient method to assess carbon stocks in tropical peat soil,Evi Gusmayanti,A cost-efficient method to assess carbon stocks in tropical peat soil,2012.0,,"Estimation of belowground carbon stocks in tropical wetland forests requires funding for laboratory analyses and suitable facilities, which are often lacking in developing nations where most tropical wetlands are found. It is therefore beneficial to develop simple analytical tools to assist belowground carbon estimation where financial and technical limitations are common. Here we use published and original data to describe soil carbon density (kgC m−3; Cd) as a function of bulk density (gC cm−3; Bd), which can be used to rapidly estimate belowground carbon storage using Bd measurements only. Predicted carbon densities and stocks are compared with those obtained from direct carbon analysis for ten peat swamp forest stands in three national parks of Indonesia. Analysis of soil carbon density and bulk density from the literature indicated a strong linear relationship (Cd = Bd × 495.14 + 5.41, R2 = 0.93, n = 151) for soils with organic C content &gt; 40%. As organic C content decreases, the relationship between Cd and Bd becomes less predictable as soil texture becomes an important determinant of Cd. The equation predicted belowground C stocks to within 0.92% to 9.57% of observed values. Average bulk density of collected peat samples was 0.127 g cm−3, which is in the upper range of previous reports for Southeast Asian peatlands.

The degradation of tropical peats usually starts when the government drains and clears peat forests into open peats used for food crops, oil palm and industrial timber plantations. Major properties of tropical peat forests are high in Water Contents (WC), Loss on Ignition (LOI) and Total Organic Carbon (TOC), and low in peat pH, Dry Bulk Density (DBD), and Total Nitrogen (TN). In this study, we investigated impacts of drainage and land use change on these properties. We collected peat samples from peat forests, logged over peat forest, industrial timber plantation, community agriculture, and oil palms. We used independent t-tests and oneway ANOVA to analyze mean differences of the research variables. We found that peat pH, DBD, and TN tend to increase. A significant decrease of C/N ratio in oil palm and agriculture sites importantly denotes a high rate of peat decompositions. Water contents, LOI, and TOC are relatively constants.

Carbon mineralization dynamics of tropical peats in relation to peat characteristics. Biodiversitas 19: 1413-1421. Understanding the dynamics of carbon mineralization of peats in the tropical areas is of essential significance in controlling carbon dioxide (CO2) gas emission rates. An incubation study of tropical peats sampled from 3 different sites of the Barito Basin on the Borneo Island, Indonesia (uncultivated, used for paddy cultivation for £ 5 years and 5-10 years) was carried out to investigate a relationship between CO2 production and peat characteristics. Results of study revealed that land use change from uncultivated peats to paddy fields resulted in significant changes in the chemical structure of peat organic carbon. Carbohydrate contents of the peat decreased significantly as a consequence of the conversion of natural peats to paddy fields. However, the paddy peats contained higher lignin than uncultivated peats. Changes in the chemical structure of the tropical peats resulted in changes in carbon mineralization. Carbon mineralization of uncultivated peats ranged from 2925-5310 mg CO2-C kg-1 peat, while carbon mineralization of 1065-2678 mg CO2-C kg-1 C peat was observed for paddy peats. Moreover, carbon mineralization data obtained from the experiment fitted properly to a two-pool C mineralization model. The developed carbon mineralization model showed that slowly and rapidly decomposable pools have a close relation with rubbed fiber and carbohydrate content data.

The degradation of tropical peats usually starts when the government drains and clears peat forests into open peats used for food crops, oil palm and industrial timber plantations. Major properties of tropical peat forests are high in Water Contents (WC), Loss on Ignition (LOI) and Total Organic Carbon (TOC), and low in peat pH, Dry Bulk Density (DBD), and Total Nitrogen (TN). In this study, we investigated impacts of drainage and land use change on these properties. We collected peat samples from peat forests, logged over peat forest, industrial timber plantation, community agriculture, and oil palms. We used independent t-tests and oneway ANOVA to analyze mean differences of the research variables. We found that peat pH, DBD, and TN tend to increase. A significant decrease of C/N ratio in oil palm and agriculture sites importantly denotes a high rate of peat decompositions. Water contents, LOI, and TOC are relatively constants. We suggest that changes in pH, DBD, TN and atomic C/N ratio are important indicators for assessing tropical peat degradation.

Evaluation of in vitro antagonistic activity of fungi from peatlands against Ganoderma species under acidic conditions. Biodiversitas 21: 2935-2945. The use of peatlands is a significant contributor to the world’s palm oil production. A serious problem of oil palm plantations in peatlands is the high incidence of basal stem rot (BSR) disease caused by Ganoderma, which has a higher attack rate than on mineral soils. There is no effective way to control Ganoderma in peatlands. At present, the effort for the same focuses on environment-friendly biological methods; however, this is constrained by the unavailability of appropriate biological agents for peatlands. The development of biological control agents for peatlands is hampered by limited data on biological control of Ganoderma in peatlands. This research was conducted to evaluate the in vitro antagonistic activity of fungi isolated from a peatland in acidic pH conditions. Twenty-seven Ganoderma-antagonistic fungi from peatland were evaluated for their activity and their ability to antagonism in vitro within a pH range of 2-7. The results show that most antagonistic fungi from peatland, based on biomass weight, the sporulation ability, and germination of conidium, were able to grow optimally at pH 3.0-4.0, indicating that most of the Ganoderma-antagonistic fungi from peatland can be used as biological control agents for BSR on oil palms in peatlands.",evaluation of in vitro antagonistic activity of fungi from peatlands against ganoderma species under acidic condition supriyanto purwanto poromarto sh supyani  evaluation of in vitro antagonistic activity of fungi from peatlands against ganoderma species under acidic conditions biodiversitas   the use of peatlands is a significant contributor to the worlds palm oil production a serious problem of oil palm plantations in peatlands is the high incidence of basal stem rot bsr disease caused by ganoderma which has a higher attack rate than on mineral soils there is no effective way to control ganoderma in peatlands at present the effort for the same focuses on environmentfriendly biological methods however this is constrained by the unavailability of appropriate biological agents for peatlands the development of biological control agents for peatlands is hampered by limited data on biological control of ganoderma in peatlands this research was conducted to evaluate the in vitro antagonistic activity of fungi isolated from a peatland in acidic ph conditions twentyseven ganodermaantagonistic fungi from peatland were evaluated for their activity and their ability to antagonism in vitro within a ph range of  the results show that most antagonistic fungi from peatland based on biomass weight the sporulation ability and germination of conidium were able to grow optimally at ph  indicating that most of the ganodermaantagonistic fungi from peatland can be used as biological control agents for bsr on oil palms in peatlands,SDG 15,Primer

Strategy for realizing regional rural water security on tropical peatland,Tatang Abdurrahman,Strategy for Realizing Regional Rural Water Security on Tropical Peatland,2021.0,,"the need for clean water and proper sanitation is, globally, a basic human requirement, and Indonesia is no exception. Clean water and adequate sanitation are the sixth goal of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and targets include to ensure the availability of clean water and sustainable sanitation for all by 2030. The achievement of targets in water supply and sanitation in Indonesia is still lagging behind other fields. There are differences in the ease of obtaining access to clean water sources in urban and rural areas, especially for rural communities living on peatlands who experience issues in being provided with clean water. The difficulty is that, even though the amount of available water is relatively large, its quality is low. Barriers to the equitable distribution of services by the government to the entire community are caused by the limited availability of funding, the geographical conditions of scattered settlements, and the limited capacity of human resources. As a result of this problem, it is necessary to formulate a management strategy for providing access to clean water and sanitation for rural communities on peatlands. This research uses the case-study method. The management strategy was formulated on the basis of the environmental and socioeconomic conditions of the community. This method was used to test the effectiveness of the formulated strategy in realizing water security on peatlands in the village of Wajok Hilir. The resulting management strategy can be applied to other villages that have the same land characteristics. The strategy to realize water security for rural communities on peatlands is a self-service strategy. The implementation of the self-service strategy needs to be supported by infrastructure in the form of peat water treatment plant buildings, wells drilled to aquifer depths, and canal blocking to control the groundwater level in peatlands. The management strategy is carried out with community participation, considering that peatlands are a potential water source to meet clean water needs and achieve sustainable water security targets.

Propolis supplementation affects performance intestinal morphology and bacterial population of broiler chickens,Rakhmad Perkasa Harahap,"Propolis supplementation affects performance, intestinal morphology, and bacterial population of broiler chickens",2021.0,,"meta-analysis was conducted to examine the effect of supplementing the diet of broiler chickens with propolis on growth, bacterial population of the intestine, antiviral serum concentration, intestinal morphology, and digestive enzyme activities in broiler chickens. Forty peer-reviewed articles that had been published between 2003 and 2019 were identified using the PRISMA protocol and included in the study. Data were analysed with mixed model methodology, in which the studies were considered random effects, whereas the level of supplemental propolis was considered a fixed effect. Responses to propolis supplementation in bodyweight (BW) and average daily gain (ADG) were quadratic, but average daily feed intake (ADFI) was not affected. Propolis supplementation improved feed conversion ratio (FCR) significantly as a linear function of the level of supplement. The optimum level of supplementation was between 256 and 262 mg/kg feed and produced maximum ADG and final BW. There was a tendency for mortality to decrease because of propolis supplementation. Propolis had no detectable effect on serum antiviral concentration, intestinal bacterial population or intestinal morphology. Among digestive enzymes, only sucrase increased linearly as propolis was increased. Thus, supplementation with propolis increased the growth performance of broiler chickens positively and the effect was dose dependent. This may have been partly because of an improvement in sucrase activity and other factors related to the nutritional content of propolis.

Dominant conservation parameters to control environmental destruction of oxbow lake in Kapuas River Basin Indonesia,Henny Herawati,"Dominant conservation parameters to control environmental destruction of oxbow lake in Kapuas River Basin, Indonesia",2024.0,,"Global climate change has significantly impacted the ecosystem of a specific aquatic region, including its lake area. Lakes provide immense benefits in efforts to meet various needs and enhance community well-being. These include the provision of raw water for clean drinking, household and urban water supply, industry, supplemental irrigation for agriculture, hydroelectric power generation, and various other purposes. However, fluctuations in river water availability trigger adjustments in both the river flow patterns and their inherent characteristics. These modifications in land features and ecosystems have consequently brought the morphological transformations in rivers throughout the adjacent region. The characteristics and functions of oxbow lakes must be preserved, and conservation efforts must be undertaken. To maintain their functionality, it is essential to conduct a study to determine the dominant parameters that influence the characteristics of oxbow lakes. This study aims to identify the primary parameters for conservation efforts in oxbow lakes. Based on a field survey of physical conditions, most oxbow lakes exhibit suboptimal conditions, as nearly all water storage areas are already overgrown with wild vegetation and possess high sediment levels.

Assessment of annual high-discharge patterns in Kapuas River using information and complexity measures,Henny Herawati,Assessment of annual high-discharge patterns in Kapuas River using information and complexity measures,2023.0,,"recent study revealed that the amount of rainfall on the Kapuas River has increased over the last 30 years. The increase in rainfall increases the possibility of high discharge events, which might lead to destructive flooding of the Kapuas River and its tributaries. Hence, the ability to characterise the pattern of high discharge events is compulsory for the development and management of the Kapuas River watershed. The main objective of this study was to assess and characterise flood patterns in the Kapuas River watershed. To achieve this objective, we utilised information and complexity measures that consisted of mean information gain ( MIG), effective measure complexity ( EMC) and fluctuation complexity ( FC) in daily water level records from 2002 to 2011 from a gauging station in Sanggau, West Kalimantan Province. The results revealed that flood events in the Kapuas River were mainly generated by the Indo-Australian monsoon, which occurred from December to March. The anomaly in 2010, when intense flood events were observed during the dry season, can be identified as the effect of a strong negative El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Additionally, the analysis of the information and complexity measures indicates that: (i) EMC, which reflects the length of flood events, tends to increase along with greater discharge, and (ii) MIG and FC, which denote the degree of randomness and fluctuation of flood events, respectively, tended to have higher values when the number of months without high discharge was less.",assessment of annual highdischarge patterns in kapuas river using information and complexity measures recent study revealed that the amount of rainfall on the kapuas river has increased over the last  years the increase in rainfall increases the possibility of high discharge events which might lead to destructive flooding of the kapuas river and its tributaries hence the ability to characterise the pattern of high discharge events is compulsory for the development and management of the kapuas river watershed the main objective of this study was to assess and characterise flood patterns in the kapuas river watershed to achieve this objective we utilised information and complexity measures that consisted of mean information gain  mig effective measure complexity  emc and fluctuation complexity  fc in daily water level records from  to  from a gauging station in sanggau west kalimantan province the results revealed that flood events in the kapuas river were mainly generated by the indoaustralian monsoon which occurred from december to march the anomaly in  when intense flood events were observed during the dry season can be identified as the effect of a strong negative el niosouthern oscillation enso additionally the analysis of the information and complexity measures indicates that i emc which reflects the length of flood events tends to increase along with greater discharge and ii mig and fc which denote the degree of randomness and fluctuation of flood events respectively tended to have higher values when the number of months without high discharge was less,"SDG 15, SDG 9",Tersier

Strategy for realizing regional rural water security on tropical peatland,Henny Herawati,Strategy for Realizing Regional Rural Water Security on Tropical Peatland,2021.0,,"the need for clean water and proper sanitation is, globally, a basic human requirement, and Indonesia is no exception. Clean water and adequate sanitation are the sixth goal of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and targets include to ensure the availability of clean water and sustainable sanitation for all by 2030. The achievement of targets in water supply and sanitation in Indonesia is still lagging behind other fields. There are differences in the ease of obtaining access to clean water sources in urban and rural areas, especially for rural communities living on peatlands who experience issues in being provided with clean water. The difficulty is that, even though the amount of available water is relatively large, its quality is low. Barriers to the equitable distribution of services by the government to the entire community are caused by the limited availability of funding, the geographical conditions of scattered settlements, and the limited capacity of human resources. As a result of this problem, it is necessary to formulate a management strategy for providing access to clean water and sanitation for rural communities on peatlands. This research uses the case-study method. The management strategy was formulated on the basis of the environmental and socioeconomic conditions of the community. This method was used to test the effectiveness of the formulated strategy in realizing water security on peatlands in the village of Wajok Hilir. The resulting management strategy can be applied to other villages that have the same land characteristics. The strategy to realize water security for rural communities on peatlands is a self-service strategy.

The mangrove ecosystem in Karimunting Bay of West Kalimantan, Indonesia is one of the conservation areas with an area of 138.2 ha. Vegetation making up of that mangrove ecosystem is dominated by Avicennia marina. The existence of mangroves has a role in carbon storage. The ability to store carbon in mangrove forest ecosystems is four times greater than in other tropical forests around the world. Mangrove stems have the greatest ability in storing carbon by up to 55.52%. The research objective was to analyze the potential for carbon storage in the fringe mangrove ecosystem which was dominated by A. marina. This research method is based on a survey of vegetation density in the field. The survey was carried out in Karimunting Bay in three parts of the bay, north, central, and south. Each part of the bay consists of two locations, namely at the front of the breakwater towards the sea and behind the breakwater towards the land. Each location consisted of a plot of 10 x 10 with five replications. The vegetation parameters measured are the types of growth forms, the mangrove ecosystem species, and the diameter and height of the trees, as well as environmental parameters (pH, temperature, and salinity). Destructive method was used on A. marina stems for estimating analysis of mangrove carbon storage in the laboratory. A. marina stem samples were used to test the carbon content with LOI (Lost on Ignition) analysis. Analysis of changes in mangrove area is based on the 2009 and 2019 landscape images.

A Forecasting Approach for IoT-Based Energy and Power Quality Monitoring in Buildings,Seno Darmawan Panjaitan,A Forecasting Approach for IoT-Based Energy and Power Quality Monitoring in Buildings,2022.0,,"paper proposes a novel energy consumption and power quality forecasting technique based on the combination of poly-exponential (PE) and random forest (RF). This technique paves away seamlessly integrating the forecast to the Internet-of-things (IoT)-based monitoring system due to its capability of improving computational efficiency. For the experimental setup, the monitoring system in a building supplied the data for forecasting consisting of daily energy consumption and power quality parameters. The developed algorithm for efficient computational forecasting has already considered the space limitation in online real-time monitoring with a minor effect on the model prediction error (less than 0.3% in our experimental setup). The algorithm can alert the user once an indication of energy waste (more than the determined boundary) or the actual voltage violated the tolerance might occur. An experimental dataset taken from the Bappeda Pontianak building in West Kalimantan, Indonesia, shows that the proposed algorithm required fewer samples than the RF yet could predict the daily energy consumption and voltage inside a building accurately up to 96%. Note to Practitioners—As the energy and power quality monitoring using IoT is applied for buildings nowadays, how to handle the big data and forecast the energy and power for evaluation and strategy in buildings is significant. A standard solution is to apply sophisticated technology with a high computational resource. However, this will increase the cost either in the investment or maintenance. The algorithm in this paper is a new approach for IoT-based monitoring and forecasting of energy consumption and power quality by combining PE and RT models, which is relatively cheap in computational complexity yet does not require much space to store in an online setup. The proposed algorithm first creates the model with the RT algorithm and then tracks the residual generated by this algorithm with the PE model and extended Kalman filter. We then show that this model can predict the daily energy consumption accurately. The algorithm based on this model can be integrated into the monitoring system and advise the user when the current energy consumption has passed the ""normal"" energy consumption concerning the information from previous days. Experiments on a building located in Pontianak show that this algorithm is applicable and can precisely predict daily energy consumption and power quality with a limited amount of data. In future research, we plan to expand this technique further, such that it is not only for monitoring purposes but also for control.",a forecasting approach for iotbased energy and power quality monitoring in buildings paper proposes a novel energy consumption and power quality forecasting technique based on the combination of polyexponential pe and random forest rf this technique paves away seamlessly integrating the forecast to the internetofthings iotbased monitoring system due to its capability of improving computational efficiency for the experimental setup the monitoring system in a building supplied the data for forecasting consisting of daily energy consumption and power quality parameters the developed algorithm for efficient computational forecasting has already considered the space limitation in online realtime monitoring with a minor effect on the model prediction error less than  in our experimental setup the algorithm can alert the user once an indication of energy waste more than the determined boundary or the actual voltage violated the tolerance might occur an experimental dataset taken from the bappeda pontianak building in west kalimantan indonesia shows that the proposed algorithm required fewer samples than the rf yet could predict the daily energy consumption and voltage inside a building accurately up to  note to practitionersas the energy and power quality monitoring using iot is applied for buildings nowadays how to handle the big data and forecast the energy and power for evaluation and strategy in buildings is significant a standard solution is to apply sophisticated technology with a high computational resource however this will increase the cost either in the investment or maintenance the algorithm in this paper is a new approach for iotbased monitoring and forecasting of energy consumption and power quality by combining pe and rt models which is relatively cheap in computational complexity yet does not require much space to store in an online setup the proposed algorithm first creates the model with the rt algorithm and then tracks the residual generated by this algorithm with the pe model and extended kalman filter we then show that this model can predict the daily energy consumption accurately the algorithm based on this model can be integrated into the monitoring system and advise the user when the current energy consumption has passed the normal energy consumption concerning the information from previous days experiments on a building located in pontianak show that this algorithm is applicable and can precisely predict daily energy consumption and power quality with a limited amount of data in future research we plan to expand this technique further such that it is not only for monitoring purposes but also for control,SDG 9,Tersier

Nevertheless, a common indicator of upwelling is the sea surface temperature (SSI) lower than the surrounding areas, high concentrations of chlorophyll-a, as well as high salinity and density. In coastal upwelling, a lower temperature will be detected near the coast, while warmer temperatures towards offshore. This condition leads to form unique patterns contour of sea surface temperature By using the data of SST derived from satellites, SST can be represented with the color and/or contour. Each color pixel value represents a particular SST. The initial phase of this research is to develop a model for the identification of upwelling based on the pixel and contour patterns.

Brackish peat water desalination treatment using a combination of continuous electrocoagulation and filtration technique,Stefanus Barlian Soeryamassoeka,Brackish peat water desalination treatment using a combination of continuous electrocoagulation and filtration technique,2025.0,,"Coastal regions possess a distinct water quality known as brackish peat water, resulting from a blend of peat and seawater. Unfortunately, this water type cannot serve as a freshwater source without treatment. Hence, it’s crucial to explore effective and cost-efficient treatment methods. This study focuses on evaluating the efficacy of continuous electrocoagulation and filtration techniques in converting brackish peat water, characterized by peat soil, into freshwater. Desalination via electrocoagulation supports key elements of the blue economy, including water availability, economic growth, and community resilience. Samples were collected from the Kakap river mouth. Six parameters were examined before and after treatment: salinity, temperature, total dissolved solids (TDS), pH, iron (Fe), manganese (Mn). Salinity, pH, temperature, and TDS were measured using a calibrated multi-functional water quality tester. Iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) levels were assessed according to SNI 6980.84:2019 standards, conducted at the laboratory of the Institute of Industrial Standardization and Services (Baristand) in Pontianak. The results show that the electrocoagulation and filtration can reduce salinity and TDS ranging from ~40 to ~83%, where the best outcome for desalinating brackish peat water through EC and filtration occurs when the EC process runs for 4 hours, with a filtration detention time of 30 minutes. Additionally, statistical analysis using ANOVA revealed the p-value is smaller than 0.05, indicating a significant effect of salinity reduction. Morover, the electrocoagulation and filtration substantially lower iron levels, while manganese concentration initially increases after 1 hour of EC. However, during 2 and 3 hours of EC, manganese levels decrease to meet acceptable standards. For effective salinity reduction in brackish peat water, it is essential to integrate electrocoagulation with filtration process.

The survival rate of the patients can fall as low as 15.7% if the cancer cell has reached its final stage. Delayed treatment of melanoma can be attributed to its likeness to that of common nevus (moles). Two machine learning models were developed, each with a different approach and algorithm, to detect the presence of melanoma. Image classification is using the regression algorithm, and object detection is using deep learning. The two models are then compared, and the best model is determined according to the achieved metrics. The testing was conducted using 120 testing data and is made up of 60 positive data and 60 negative data. The testing result shows that object detection achieved 70% accuracy than image classification’s 68%. More importantly, linear regression’s 43% false-negative rate is noticeably high compared to convolutional neural network’s (CNN) 25%. A false-negative rate of 43% means almost half of sick patients tested using image classification will be diagnosed as healthy. This is dangerous as it can lead to delayed treatment and, ultimately, death. Thus it can be concluded that CNN is the best method in detecting the presence of melanoma.",comparing the performance of linear regression versus deep learning on detecting melanoma skin cancer using apple core ml is a type of deadly skin cancer the survival rate of the patients can fall as low as  if the cancer cell has reached its final stage delayed treatment of melanoma can be attributed to its likeness to that of common nevus moles two machine learning models were developed each with a different approach and algorithm to detect the presence of melanoma image classification is using the regression algorithm and object detection is using deep learning the two models are then compared and the best model is determined according to the achieved metrics the testing was conducted using  testing data and is made up of  positive data and  negative data the testing result shows that object detection achieved  accuracy than image classifications  more importantly linear regressions  falsenegative rate is noticeably high compared to convolutional neural networks cnn  a falsenegative rate of  means almost half of sick patients tested using image classification will be diagnosed as healthy this is dangerous as it can lead to delayed treatment and ultimately death thus it can be concluded that cnn is the best method in detecting the presence of melanoma,Tidak Teridentifikasi,Tidak Ada

This article explores the complexity by assessing the vulnerability of a specific area to poor WASH conditions using a qualitative approach. Methods We present our findings for the district of East Sumba in Indonesia. This area is known as one of the poorest regions in Indonesia with inadequate WASH services, indigenous belief that hinder the practice of WASH-related behaviours, and has a high rate of children malnutrition. All the factors that contribute to poor WASH conditions were discussed through the lens of the Financial, Institutional, Environmental, Technological, and Social (FIETS) framework. We then summarised the factors and visualized the “system” using a mind map which shows how factors are interconnected and helps to find the root causes of poor WASH conditions. Results There are three main challenges that inhibit the improvement of WASH conditions in this area: inadequate institutional capacity, water scarcity, and poor socio-economic conditions. We found that a village leader is the most important actor who influences the sustainability of WASH services in this area and healthcare workers are influential WASH promoters. This study also shows how culture shapes people’s daily lives and institution performance, and influences the current WASH conditions in East Sumba. The mind map shows there is an overlap and interconnection between FIEST aspects and WASH conditions in the study area.

Since 1960, Peniraman Village has been known for its soil and rock mining. Mining increases the risk of environmental degradation by increasing the demand for freshwater provisioning services. This study aims to assess the impact of damage from mining in Peniraman Village on groundwater potential and the environment's carrying capacity based on ecosystem service. Ecosystem services are analyzed using two determinants: land cover and landscape, with a spatial method. This study resulted in a large forest change between 1972 and 2020, which was estimated to lose 16.5 hectares of forest each year, whereas Peniraman Village will lose its forest in 26 years. There was also a land conversion in primary swamp forests into open land for various community activities from 1972-2020, mostly agriculture, settlement, and plantation. On the other hand, the mining area will be exhausted in 30-40 years given the current mining rate. These actions shifted the class of groundwater provisioning services from very high to very low. The water potential was calculated based on the ecosystem services that have intermediate and low-level class potential in Peniraman Village of 1,077.98 hectares, or 48.15% of the total area.

Strategy for realizing regional rural water security on tropical peatland,Aji Ali Akbar,Strategy for Realizing Regional Rural Water Security on Tropical Peatland,2021.0,,"the need for clean water and proper sanitation is, globally, a basic human requirement, and Indonesia is no exception. Clean water and adequate sanitation are the sixth goal of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and targets include to ensure the availability of clean water and sustainable sanitation for all by 2030. The achievement of targets in water supply and sanitation in Indonesia is still lagging behind other fields. There are differences in the ease of obtaining access to clean water sources in urban and rural areas, especially for rural communities living on peatlands who experience issues in being provided with clean water. The difficulty is that, even though the amount of available water is relatively large, its quality is low. Barriers to the equitable distribution of services by the government to the entire community are caused by the limited availability of funding, the geographical conditions of scattered settlements, and the limited capacity of human resources. As a result of this problem, it is necessary to formulate a management strategy for providing access to clean water and sanitation for rural communities on peatlands. This research uses the case-study method. The management strategy was formulated on the basis of the environmental and socioeconomic conditions of the community. This method was used to test the effectiveness of the formulated strategy in realizing water security on peatlands in the village of Wajok Hilir. The resulting management strategy can be applied to other villages that have the same land characteristics. The strategy to realize water security for rural communities on peatlands is a self-service strategy. The implementation of the self-service strategy needs to be supported by infrastructure in the form of peat water treatment plant buildings, wells drilled to aquifer depths, and canal blocking to control the groundwater level in peatlands. The management strategy is carried out with community participation, considering that peatlands are a potential water source to meet clean water needs and achieve sustainable water security targets.

Potential of mangrove ecosystem as carbon storage for global warming mitigation. Biodiversitas 21: 5353-5362. The mangrove ecosystem in Karimunting Bay of West Kalimantan, Indonesia is one of the conservation areas with an area of 138.2 ha. Vegetation making up of that mangrove ecosystem is dominated by Avicennia marina. The existence of mangroves has a role in carbon storage. The ability to store carbon in mangrove forest ecosystems is four times greater than in other tropical forests around the world. Mangrove stems have the greatest ability in storing carbon by up to 55.52%. The research objective was to analyze the potential for carbon storage in the fringe mangrove ecosystem which was dominated by A. marina. This research method is based on a survey of vegetation density in the field. The survey was carried out in Karimunting Bay in three parts of the bay, north, central, and south. Each part of the bay consists of two locations, namely at the front of the breakwater towards the sea and behind the breakwater towards the land. Each location consisted of a plot of 10 x 10 with five replications. The vegetation parameters measured are the types of growth forms, the mangrove ecosystem species, and the diameter and height of the trees, as well as environmental parameters (pH, temperature, and salinity). Destructive method was used on A. marina stems for estimating analysis of mangrove carbon storage in the laboratory. A. marina stem samples were used to test the carbon content with LOI (Lost on Ignition) analysis. Analysis of changes in mangrove area is based on the 2009 and 2019 landscape images. The results show that the mangrove ecosystem of Karimunting Bay has a total density of 177,480 individuals/ha. The amount of carbon storage reached 99,231 mg/ha in 2019 and predictions of total carbon storage over the last 10 years are as much as 13,717,951 tons.

A Forecasting Approach for IoT-Based Energy and Power Quality Monitoring in Buildings,Bomo Wibowo S,A Forecasting Approach for IoT-Based Energy and Power Quality Monitoring in Buildings,2022.0,,"paper proposes a novel energy consumption and power quality forecasting technique based on the combination of poly-exponential (PE) and random forest (RF). This technique paves away seamlessly integrating the forecast to the Internet-of-things (IoT)-based monitoring system due to its capability of improving computational efficiency. For the experimental setup, the monitoring system in a building supplied the data for forecasting consisting of daily energy consumption and power quality parameters. The developed algorithm for efficient computational forecasting has already considered the space limitation in online real-time monitoring with a minor effect on the model prediction error (less than 0.3% in our experimental setup). The algorithm can alert the user once an indication of energy waste (more than the determined boundary) or the actual voltage violated the tolerance might occur. An experimental dataset taken from the Bappeda Pontianak building in West Kalimantan, Indonesia, shows that the proposed algorithm required fewer samples than the RF yet could predict the daily energy consumption and voltage inside a building accurately up to 96%. Note to Practitioners—As the energy and power quality monitoring using IoT is applied for buildings nowadays, how to handle the big data and forecast the energy and power for evaluation and strategy in buildings is significant. A standard solution is to apply sophisticated technology with a high computational resource. However, this will increase the cost either in the investment or maintenance. The algorithm in this paper is a new approach for IoT-based monitoring and forecasting of energy consumption and power quality by combining PE and RT models, which is relatively cheap in computational complexity yet does not require much space to store in an online setup. The proposed algorithm first creates the model with the RT algorithm and then tracks the residual generated by this algorithm with the PE model and extended Kalman filter. We then show that this model can predict the daily energy consumption accurately. The algorithm based on this model can be integrated into the monitoring system and advise the user when the current energy consumption has passed the ""normal"" energy consumption concerning the information from previous days. Experiments on a building located in Pontianak show that this algorithm is applicable and can precisely predict daily energy consumption and power quality with a limited amount of data. In future research, we plan to expand this technique further, such that it is not only for monitoring purposes but also for control.",a forecasting approach for iotbased energy and power quality monitoring in buildings paper proposes a novel energy consumption and power quality forecasting technique based on the combination of polyexponential pe and random forest rf this technique paves away seamlessly integrating the forecast to the internetofthings iotbased monitoring system due to its capability of improving computational efficiency for the experimental setup the monitoring system in a building supplied the data for forecasting consisting of daily energy consumption and power quality parameters the developed algorithm for efficient computational forecasting has already considered the space limitation in online realtime monitoring with a minor effect on the model prediction error less than  in our experimental setup the algorithm can alert the user once an indication of energy waste more than the determined boundary or the actual voltage violated the tolerance might occur an experimental dataset taken from the bappeda pontianak building in west kalimantan indonesia shows that the proposed algorithm required fewer samples than the rf yet could predict the daily energy consumption and voltage inside a building accurately up to  note to practitionersas the energy and power quality monitoring using iot is applied for buildings nowadays how to handle the big data and forecast the energy and power for evaluation and strategy in buildings is significant a standard solution is to apply sophisticated technology with a high computational resource however this will increase the cost either in the investment or maintenance the algorithm in this paper is a new approach for iotbased monitoring and forecasting of energy consumption and power quality by combining pe and rt models which is relatively cheap in computational complexity yet does not require much space to store in an online setup the proposed algorithm first creates the model with the rt algorithm and then tracks the residual generated by this algorithm with the pe model and extended kalman filter we then show that this model can predict the daily energy consumption accurately the algorithm based on this model can be integrated into the monitoring system and advise the user when the current energy consumption has passed the normal energy consumption concerning the information from previous days experiments on a building located in pontianak show that this algorithm is applicable and can precisely predict daily energy consumption and power quality with a limited amount of data in future research we plan to expand this technique further such that it is not only for monitoring purposes but also for control,SDG 9,Tersier

The Photovoltaic (PV) system, coupled with batteries, energized each inverter. Solar power data from the equator city area were included in the PV system for simulation with its dynamics due to weather fluctuation. The proposed power-sharing control approach combined with integral action to improve the power quality and power-sharing accuracy. It conveys three considerations for flexible power-sharing: using virtual load voltage and the frequency at grid connection terminal (i.e., point of common coupling) in the controller without direct measurement to avoid using external communication, applying those virtual values to calculate the required parameters for an accurate power-sharing and proposing a concept of extended traditional droop control coefficient to be able to apply for various line impedances. The presented case study had two inverters supported by dynamics coupled sources from a PV system installed in an equatorial city used in the MATLAB experiment and batteries function block connected in parallel. Those inverters, located in different sub-systems, supplied two sub-systems (i.e., Microgrids) with different line impedance.

Three factors were taken into consideration and their domains of variation established as follows; contact force, from 2 to 10 N; charging time, from 10 to 290 s and the frequency of back-and-forth sliding motion, from 0.5 to 1.5 Hz. The distribution of the electric charge at the surface of polymers was measured by the auto-compensated inductive probe connected to an electrostatic voltmeter. A mathematical model allowing the evaluation of the effects of the various factors and of their interactions was obtained. A comparison between the triboelectic behavior of PTFE, PVC and ABS was made. It was found that electric potential increases with the contact force and the charging time, but decreases with the frequency of the back-and-forth sliding motion.",experimental modeling of the conformalcontact tribocharging of polymers charge generated by friction is well known but poorly understood the aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of various factors involved in the frictional conformalcontact the study focused on the tribocharging process between two polymer slabs as it is a multifactorial process with several interacting variables the experimental design methodology was employed for its modeling three factors were taken into consideration and their domains of variation established as follows contact force from  to  n charging time from  to  s and the frequency of backandforth sliding motion from  to  hz the distribution of the electric charge at the surface of polymers was measured by the autocompensated inductive probe connected to an electrostatic voltmeter a mathematical model allowing the evaluation of the effects of the various factors and of their interactions was obtained a comparison between the triboelectic behavior of ptfe pvc and abs was made it was found that electric potential increases with the contact force and the charging time but decreases with the frequency of the backandforth sliding motion,"SDG 7, SDG 9",Tersier

Social activity and adaptive urban network in strategic areas in Indonesia,Syaiful Muazir,Social Activity and Adaptive Urban Network in Strategic Areas in Indonesia,2016.0,,"INTRODUCTION Strategic Areas in West Kalimantan, Indonesia In response to the more increasing urban problems, Indonesia has attempted to develop the spatial planning framework. The strategy and policy within the  spatial plan are divided into two forms of plans: (1) spatial structure and (2) spatial pattern. Inside a spatial structure, recognize strategic areas. Strategic areas are assigned based upon the  importance and priorities (e.g. security, economic development, etc.). Besides, the term of strategic areas is also used in urban hierarchy system, river basin, and  strategic areas. As for the urban hierarchy system, several areas are promoted to be national strategic activity center; defined as an urban area assigned to foster the development in a number of  border areas. So far, there are 26  strategic activity centers (borderlands) distributed across Indonesia, and 5 of them located in West Kalimantan. Another translation plan to promote the border areas is  tourism strategic area, organized under  tourism plan. To execute the development plan of the tourism sector in Indonesia, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism has set 88 National Tourism Strategic Areas as the development priorities, and two of them located in West Kalimantan. What is interesting from both regencies is that each of regencies (Kapuas Hulu and Sambas) is the border regency bounded directly with Sarawak-Malaysia. If seen from these conditions; the closeness of location and the attraction of  tourism strategic areas actually can be a magnet for the tourists/visitors from Malaysia and Brunei Darussalam (in particular), if all the infrastructures and facilities are well prepared. Problems, Issues, and Network Logic In view of its location and consideration in the past development that are more concerns in security matters, it leads to the untouched welfare development within the border areas. Today, most of the borders areas in Indonesia have still becoming the lagging areas with the limited social facilities and economic infrastructure if compared to a number of opposite countries. For this, border areas often have a low accessibility and isolated, so the residents prefer to interact with their neighboring country (Malaysia) rather than the city nearby from Indonesia side. One of the strategic regency in West Kalimantan is Sambas regency, which have a tourism strategic area in Sambas district and  strategic activity center (borderland) in Paloh district. General speaking, as a strategic region, infrastructure condition and accessibility in Sambas regency are still oriented to the areas along the main corridor that connects the main economic attractiveness (province capital city). These areas become the areas with high connectivity as well as its economic potential (e.g. Selakau, Pemangkat, Tebas, and Sambas). However, most of the advance-connected areas are still unable to push surrounding areas (e.g. border areas) to be more advance, if seen from the profile gap on the regency (e.g. population density, facilities, infrastructure, business units, etc.) Seeing by its current condition, the interaction between the two strategic areas seems to be unbalanced. As a growth machine for the surrounding, these two areas should be able to interact with both, balanced, and has an equal distribution in accordance with the specifications of each area. Therefore, one of the concepts that can be used to analyze is by seeing the interaction. Due to its interaction, the approach that can be used is network approach. The network concept is based upon relationships between entities such as organization or people (Scott, et al. 2008). This approach is based on the relationship between entities and searches for the structure of the relationship. Related to urban development/planning, the principles of network analysis applied in the form of urban network. …",social activity and adaptive urban network in strategic areas in indonesia introduction strategic areas in west kalimantan indonesia in response to the more increasing urban problems indonesia has attempted to develop the spatial planning framework the strategy and policy within the  spatial plan are divided into two forms of plans  spatial structure and  spatial pattern inside a spatial structure recognize strategic areas strategic areas are assigned based upon the  importance and priorities eg security economic development etc besides the term of strategic areas is also used in urban hierarchy system river basin and  strategic areas as for the urban hierarchy system several areas are promoted to be national strategic activity center defined as an urban area assigned to foster the development in a number of  border areas so far there are   strategic activity centers borderlands distributed across indonesia and  of them located in west kalimantan another translation plan to promote the border areas is  tourism strategic area organized under  tourism plan to execute the development plan of the tourism sector in indonesia the ministry of culture and tourism has set  national tourism strategic areas as the development priorities and two of them located in west kalimantan what is interesting from both regencies is that each of regencies kapuas hulu and sambas is the border regency bounded directly with sarawakmalaysia if seen from these conditions the closeness of location and the attraction of  tourism strategic areas actually can be a magnet for the touristsvisitors from malaysia and brunei darussalam in particular if all the infrastructures and facilities are well prepared problems issues and network logic in view of its location and consideration in the past development that are more concerns in security matters it leads to the untouched welfare development within the border areas today most of the borders areas in indonesia have still becoming the lagging areas with the limited social facilities and economic infrastructure if compared to a number of opposite countries for this border areas often have a low accessibility and isolated so the residents prefer to interact with their neighboring country malaysia rather than the city nearby from indonesia side one of the strategic regency in west kalimantan is sambas regency which have a tourism strategic area in sambas district and  strategic activity center borderland in paloh district general speaking as a strategic region infrastructure condition and accessibility in sambas regency are still oriented to the areas along the main corridor that connects the main economic attractiveness province capital city these areas become the areas with high connectivity as well as its economic potential eg selakau pemangkat tebas and sambas however most of the advanceconnected areas are still unable to push surrounding areas eg border areas to be more advance if seen from the profile gap on the regency eg population density facilities infrastructure business units etc seeing by its current condition the interaction between the two strategic areas seems to be unbalanced as a growth machine for the surrounding these two areas should be able to interact with both balanced and has an equal distribution in accordance with the specifications of each area therefore one of the concepts that can be used to analyze is by seeing the interaction due to its interaction the approach that can be used is network approach the network concept is based upon relationships between entities such as organization or people scott et al  this approach is based on the relationship between entities and searches for the structure of the relationship related to urban developmentplanning the principles of network analysis applied in the form of urban network ,SDG 9,Tersier

Unveiling the potentials of circular economy values in logistics and supply chain management,Eva Faja Ripanti,Unveiling the potentials of circular economy values in logistics and supply chain management,2019.0,,"The purpose of this paper is to unveil the circular economy (CE) values with an ultimate goal to provide tenets in a format or structure that can potentially be used for designing a circular, closed-loop supply chain and reverse logistics. Design/methodology/approach This is desk-based research whose data were collected from relevant publication databases and other scientific resources, using a wide range of keywords and phrases associated with CE, reverse logistics, product recovery and other relevant terms. There are five main steps in the reformulation of CE principles: literature filtering, literature analysis, thematic analysis, value definition and value mapping. Findings In total, 15 CE values have been identified according to their fundamental concepts, behaviours, characteristics and theories. The values are grouped into principles, intrinsic attributes and enablers. These values can be embedded into the design process of product recovery management, reverse logistics and closed-loop supply chain. Research limitations/implications The paper contributes to the redefinition, identification and implementation of the CE values, as a basis for the transformation from a traditional to a more circular supply chain. The reformulation of the CE values will potentially affect the way supply chain and logistics systems considering the imperatives of circularity may be designed in the future. Originality/value The reformulation principles, intrinsic attributes and enablers of CE in this paper is considered innovative in terms of improving a better understanding of the notion of CE and how CE can be applied in the context of modern logistics and supply chain management.",unveiling the potentials of circular economy values in logistics and supply chain management the purpose of this paper is to unveil the circular economy ce values with an ultimate goal to provide tenets in a format or structure that can potentially be used for designing a circular closedloop supply chain and reverse logistics designmethodologyapproach this is deskbased research whose data were collected from relevant publication databases and other scientific resources using a wide range of keywords and phrases associated with ce reverse logistics product recovery and other relevant terms there are five main steps in the reformulation of ce principles literature filtering literature analysis thematic analysis value definition and value mapping findings in total  ce values have been identified according to their fundamental concepts behaviours characteristics and theories the values are grouped into principles intrinsic attributes and enablers these values can be embedded into the design process of product recovery management reverse logistics and closedloop supply chain research limitationsimplications the paper contributes to the redefinition identification and implementation of the ce values as a basis for the transformation from a traditional to a more circular supply chain the reformulation of the ce values will potentially affect the way supply chain and logistics systems considering the imperatives of circularity may be designed in the future originalityvalue the reformulation principles intrinsic attributes and enablers of ce in this paper is considered innovative in terms of improving a better understanding of the notion of ce and how ce can be applied in the context of modern logistics and supply chain management,"SDG 15, SDG 9",Tersier
Aligning retail reverse logistics practice with circular economy values: an exploratory framework,Eva Faja Ripanti,Aligning retail reverse logistics practice with circular economy values: an exploratory framework,2018.0,,"there is a growing body of literature concerning Circular Economy (CE), there is little, in terms of frameworks in the literature, which focuses on embedding CE values in consumer Retail Reverse Logistics (RRL) operations. The aim of this paper is to present a conceptual framework that supports the adoption of CE values within RRL operations. The framework is designed to assist both practitioners and academics in better understanding the key management aspects involved. The methodology adopts a mixed methods approach combining a desk-based research with rich empirical data from interviews with senior management practitioners and academics in the fields of CE and RRL. From this research, it was found that embedding CE values within RRL necessitates the adoption of a multi-faceted approach. The adoption of the framework will have an impact on practitioners by assisting them in moving towards a more restorative and less impactful approach to their RRL practices. The work is considered innovative and novel as this is the first time the empirical results that suggest a multi-dimensional approach embedding CE values in RRL operations are presented.",aligning retail reverse logistics practice with circular economy values an exploratory framework there is a growing body of literature concerning circular economy ce there is little in terms of frameworks in the literature which focuses on embedding ce values in consumer retail reverse logistics rrl operations the aim of this paper is to present a conceptual framework that supports the adoption of ce values within rrl operations the framework is designed to assist both practitioners and academics in better understanding the key management aspects involved the methodology adopts a mixed methods approach combining a deskbased research with rich empirical data from interviews with senior management practitioners and academics in the fields of ce and rrl from this research it was found that embedding ce values within rrl necessitates the adoption of a multifaceted approach the adoption of the framework will have an impact on practitioners by assisting them in moving towards a more restorative and less impactful approach to their rrl practices the work is considered innovative and novel as this is the first time the empirical results that suggest a multidimensional approach embedding ce values in rrl operations are presented,SDG 9,Tersier
